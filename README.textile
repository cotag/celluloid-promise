h1. Celluloid Promise

!https://secure.travis-ci.org/cotag/celluloid-promise.png!

A promise / deferred implementation for Celluloid inspired by "AngularJS":http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$q / "Kris Kowal's Q.":https://github.com/kriskowal/q

From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise apis are to asynchronous programing what try, catch and throw keywords are to synchronous programming.

<pre><code class="ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'celluloid-promise'

def asyncGreet(name)
	deferred = Celluloid::Q.defer
	
	Thread.new do
		sleep 10
		deferred.resolve("Hello #{name}")
	end
	
	deferred.promise
end


asyncGreet('Robin Hood').then(proc { |greeting|
	p "Success: #{greeting}"
}, proc { |reason|
	p "Failed: #{reason}"
})

asyncGreet('The Dude').then do |greeting|
	p "Jeff '#{greeting}' Lebowski"
end


</code></pre>


h2. Start using it now

# Read the "Documentation":http://rubydoc.info/gems/celluloid-promise/Celluloid/Promise
# Then @gem install celluloid-promise@


h2. Use case

Celluloid provides a toolkit for building concurrent applications however coordinating complex chains of concurrent events can be difficult.
Celluloid-Promise provides the following:

* allows you to track a mash up of events across Actors
* guarantees serial execution of callbacks
* callback chains are spread across multiple threads
** So multiple promise chains can be executed concurrently

Of course passing blocks around is a fairly "dangerous exercise":https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Blocks#proposal-for-fixing-blocks, so do the following and you'll be safe

* use Celluloid-Promise for flow control
* resolve and reject promises with locally scoped variables
* call Actor methods to change state or instance variables
